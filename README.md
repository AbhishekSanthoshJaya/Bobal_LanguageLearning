# CAPSTONE PROJECT - BOBAL

We decided to create Bobal, a learning app focused on helping users practice the various facets of the English language. The way Bobal stands out is our approach to the standard learning modes. The main differentiators that Bobal has are it’s ‘Speech Evaluation Technology (SET)’ and it’s ‘Recent Articles’ mode. In SET, we provide users the opportunity to have their speech evaluated and graded, similar to what they would receive in an actual test. With this mode, we allow users to have the indepence to practice speaking from the comfort of their home and without seeking our other people to practice with.
